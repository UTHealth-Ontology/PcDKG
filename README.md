# Patient-centric Drug Knowledge Graph (PcDKG)

The goal of this project is to present a simplified and minified knowledge structure of patient conceptualization from medication information. This ontology leans on patient-targetted resources and a previous ontology (Vaccine Information Statement Ontology, VISO) to construct a general patient-level "superstructure" for patient knowledge for medications. Also this work improves the previous work of VISO which focuses on the vaccine domain for health consumers by enriching it with extended concepts related to drugs. The after effect is that this works creates a generalized framework for health consumer level knowledge of medication without focusing specifically on a type of medication (e.g. vaccine).
